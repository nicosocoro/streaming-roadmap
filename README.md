# Roadmap to Streaming

This is a roadmap project created with ChatGPT to learn `Streaming Engineering`.

The roadmap is detailed in `./roadmap` folder.

## Development

Install Docker (or Rancher Desktop with **CE moby**).

Install `Dev Container` extension in Visual Studio Code.

Click Search bar and type `>` to `Run command` or directly `Cmd + Shift + P` (for Mac).

Run `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`.

This will prepare your local environment to run the project without needing to install Rust nor GStreamer in your machine.
