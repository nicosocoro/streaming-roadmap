1. Which file has the highest bitrate?

3rd video with `6046 kb/s`

2. Does the highest bitrate file look the best?

The 1st (`2119 kb/s`) and 3rd (`6046 kb/s`) are the ones which look the best.

3. Are all H.264 files actually the same?

No

4. Which file would stream better on a poor connection?

I believe the 2nd since it has the lowest bitrate `589 kb/s`.
